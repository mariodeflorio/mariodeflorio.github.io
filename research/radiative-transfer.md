<h1>Solutions of Chandrasekhar's Basic Problem in Radiative Transfer</h1>

<font size="3">
<div style="text-align: justify;"> We present a novel approach to solving the Chandrasekhar's problem in radiative transfer using the recently developed <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/math5040057"><i>Theory of Functional Connections</i></a>. The method is designed to efficiently and accurately solve the Linear Boundary Value Problem arising from the angular discretization of the integrodifferential Boltzmann equation for Radiative Transfer. The proposed algorithm follows under the category of numerical methods for the solution of radiative transfer equations. The accuracy of this new method is tested by benchmarks comparison for Mie and Haze L scattering laws. </div>
