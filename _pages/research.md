<div style="text-align: justify;"> My main research interest is the development of Physics-Informed Machine Learning frameworks and their application to several fields, such as Radiative Transfer, Rarefied-gas Dynamics, Nuclear Reactor Dynamics, Chemical Kinetics, Epidemiology, Systems Biology, and Spacecraft Orbit Determination. Below you can find some of my works. <p><br></p> </div> </font>
