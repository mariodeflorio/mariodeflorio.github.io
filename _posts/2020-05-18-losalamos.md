<h2>
Accurate Solutions of the Radiative Transfer Problem via Theory of Connections
</h2>

<font size="3">

<strong>Abstract</strong>

In this work, we present a new approach to solving the Chandrasekhar's problem in radiative transfer using the recently developed Theory of Functional Connections. The method is designed to efficiently and accurately solve the Linear One-Point Boundary Value Problem arising from the integro-differential Boltzmann equation for Radiative Transfer. The proposed algorithm follows under the category of numerical methods for the solution of Transport Equations.
