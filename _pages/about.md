<font size="3">
<div style="text-align: justify;"> I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://sie.engineering.arizona.edu/">Systems &amp; Industrial Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>. I received my M.Sc. in <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/EnergyEngineering">Energy &amp; Nuclear Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/">University of Bologna</a>, which gave me a strong interest in energy and sustainability. During my studies, I have developed a great passion for the nuclear sector for energy production, research, and radioprotection.<br><br>My main research interest is the development of Physics-Informed Machine Learning frameworks and their application to several fields, such as Radiative Transfer, Rarefied-gas Dynamics, Nuclear Reactor Dynamics, Chemical Kinetics, Epidemiology, Pharmacokinetics, and Biology systems.<br>Also, my research focuses on Remote Sensing for Asteroids and Meteorites parameters estimation.</div>
