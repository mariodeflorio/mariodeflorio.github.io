<div style="text-align: justify;"> I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href="https://appliedmath.brown.edu/">Division of Applied Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>. I received my M.Sc. in <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/EnergyEngineering">Energy &amp; Nuclear Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/">University of Bologna</a>, where I have developed a great passion for the nuclear sector for energy production, research, and radioprotection, and got my Ph.D. in <a href="https://sie.engineering.arizona.edu/">Systems &amp; Industrial Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>. <br><br>My main research interest is the development of Physics-Informed Machine Learning frameworks and their application to several fields, such as Radiative Transfer, Rarefied-gas Dynamics, Nuclear Reactor Dynamics, Orbit Propagation, Chemical Kinetics, Epidemiology, Pharmacokinetics, and Biology Systems.<br>Also, my research focuses on Remote Sensing for Asteroids and Meteorites parameters estimation.</div> <p><br></p> <i class="fas fa-download pr-1 fa-fw"></i> Download my <a href="https://github.com/mariodeflorio/mariodeflorio.github.io/raw/master/_files/CV_DeFlorio.pdf">CV</a>. </font>
