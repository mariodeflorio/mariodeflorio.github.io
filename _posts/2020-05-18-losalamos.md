<div style="text-align: justify;"> In this work, we present a new approach to solving the Chandrasekhar's problem in radiative transfer using the recently developed Theory of Functional Connections. The method is designed to efficiently and accurately solve the Linear One-Point Boundary Value Problem arising from the integro-differential Boltzmann equation for Radiative Transfer. The proposed algorithm follows under the category of numerical methods for the solution of Transport Equations.</div>
