<div style="text-align: justify;"> Mario De Florio received his BSc and MSc in  <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/EnergyEngineering">Energy &amp; Nuclear Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/">University of Bologna</a> in 2016 and 2019, respectively. He earned his PhD in <a href="https://sie.engineering.arizona.edu/">Systems &amp; Industrial Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in 2022, where he focused on optimization algorithms for parameter estimation of meteorites and asteroids, and developing physics-informed machine learning frameworks for applications in photon transport, rarefied gas dynamics, and stiff chemical kinetics. In 2023, Mario began his role as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href="https://appliedmath.brown.edu/">Division of Applied Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>. There, he advanced physics-informed machine learning algorithms for dynamical system identification from time-series data, with applications in systems biology, cardiovascular modeling, chaotic systems, and energy systems. Most recently, in September 2024, Mario joined the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a> to further his research in cutting-edge machine learning techniques for innovative advancements in renewable energy. </div> <p><br></p> <i class="fas fa-download pr-1 fa-fw"></i> Download his <a href="https://github.com/mariodeflorio/mariodeflorio.github.io/raw/master/_files/CV_DeFlorio.pdf">CV</a>. </font>
